## Overview
Welcome to the Symptom Checker and Diagnosis App! This application provides a quick diagnosis based on the symptoms you input. It utilizes a fine-tuned model based on the bert-base-cased architecture, specifically designed for text classification tasks associated with diagnosing diseases based on symptoms.

## Features
- **Symptom Input**: Enter your symptoms in the provided text area, and the app will provide a diagnosis and useful advice.
- **Multiselect Sidebar**: Easily select symptoms from different categories to describe your condition more accurately.
- **GPT-3 Integration**: If you have an API key, the app can provide additional information about the predicted disease, including a list of medications and a brief explanation, using OpenAI's GPT-3.
- **About Us Section**: Learn more about the creators of the app and their background in data science and health data.

## How to Use
1. **Home Tab**: Input your symptoms and click the "Submit" button to get a diagnosis. If you have an API key, additional information about the predicted disease will be displayed.
2. **About Us Tab**: Learn more about the creators of the app.
3. **Model Details & Evaluations Tab**: Explore the details of the model, dataset information, and performance metrics.

## Instructions
1. Run the app using Streamlit: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Enter your symptoms or select them from the multiselect sidebar.
3. Optionally, provide your GPT-3 API key for additional information.
4. Click the "Submit" button to get a diagnosis and, if available, more information about the disease.
